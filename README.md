# 2-person-Solo-Game

## Description:
This repository contains the scripts for the 2-person solo game created by Daniel Nguyen and Colin Merritt. 

## Game Description:
The player wins by catching all of the blue collectibles or at least more than half of them.
There are two ways to lose the game: The player's health goes to zero or if the player collects less than half of the fallen blue collectibles. 

## Progress/Future Consideration (So Far)
The following codes test if the input movement, colliders of the collectibles, the point system, and health system is working. This means that currently this isn't the final product of the game. In the future, we will be adding visuals and audios to the game in order to refine this. 
Originally, the collectibles are suppose to fall from a building and a little bit smaller, but since we don't have the visuals yet, for now, they fall from above the screen. 
The amount of collectibles you can collect can be changed in the code by simply changing the numbers. 
We will be also adding visuals to the win/lose screen based on the conditions. 
We might be adding a main menu when you start the game and when you finish the game, you'll be able to restart with a button on screen.
This is all for the game.
